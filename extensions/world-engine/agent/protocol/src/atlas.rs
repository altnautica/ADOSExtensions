//! Atlas world-model wire contract.
//!
//! The topic names and wire structs for the world-model program: a drone
//! captures pose-tagged keyframes, a compute node reconstructs a 3D world model
//! (splat / cloud / mesh / occupancy), and the result is consumable as shared
//! data rather than only viewable. Two topic roots:
//!
//! - `atlas.*` is the extension's own internal namespace (capture state, the
//!   keyframe lane, the offloaded-pose return leg). It stays between the
//!   extension's processes and the compute node it streams to.
//! - `plugin.world-engine.*` is the shared-data namespace other plugins
//!   subscribe to through the extension's manifest `shared_topics` declaration.
//!   It is not an open namespace: a reconstruction is derived imagery of
//!   wherever the aircraft flew, and an occupancy field is a planning input, so
//!   each topic names the capability a subscriber must hold
//!   ([`atlas_topic_subscribe_capability`]).
//!
//! Heavy payloads ride the stream lane; these topics carry small descriptors
//! only. The envelope is transport-agnostic: the identical struct travels on any
//! bearer (direct LAN, the WFB relay, or the cloud relay), so no transport
//! strings are baked in. It is also tier-aware: a light descriptor (pose plus a
//! thumbnail or an occupancy slice) is small enough for an in-flight relay link,
//! while a full keyframe (full-resolution image bytes plus the IMU window) is a
//! LAN-bulk artifact.
