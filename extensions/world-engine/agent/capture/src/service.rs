//! session, and publish the pose (every frame), the keyframe (when one is
//! selected), and the capture state (on change, and every [`STATE_REFRESH`])
//! onto the atlas bus.
//!
//! The expensive keyframe image encode runs only when the session WOULD select
//! the frame (the [`CaptureSession::would_select`] peek), so a non-keyframe
//! frame costs only a pose-stream update, not a JPEG.
//!
//! The loop also accepts operator control commands (start / stop / pause /
//! resume / status) off an mpsc channel the control socket feeds, so the GCS can
//! drive the session at runtime. The loop is the single owner of the session, so
//! every mutation — a frame ingest or a control command — happens here.
