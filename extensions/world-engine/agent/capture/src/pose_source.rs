//! Where the capture service gets the pose to tag each frame with.
//!
//! A [`PoseProvider`] hands the loop the latest known pose synchronously; the
//! work of reading a stream runs off-thread (the plugin host's telemetry
//! callback, or a socket reader task) and updates a shared cache. Three real
//! providers plus a replay provider for SITL:
//!
//! - [`TelemetryPose`] converts the flight controller's fused vehicle-state
//!   snapshot, delivered by the plugin host through `ctx.telemetry.subscribe`,
//!   to a local-frame pose (on-board "local VIO").
//! - [`OffloadPose`] reads SLAM poses a compute node returns for an NPU-less
//!   board.
//! - [`HybridPose`] uses whichever of the two arrived more recently.
//! - [`ReplayPose`] walks a fixed pose list, for the SITL harness.
//!
//! Every sample carries BOTH a wall-clock stamp and a local monotonic arrival
//! instant, and every age or ordering decision uses the monotonic one. The
//! wall-clock stamp is for the keyframe envelope (a consumer on another host
//! needs a common time base); it is never a freshness or a precedence signal,
//! because the drone and a compute node are not clock-synced and a node whose
//! clock runs fast would otherwise win every comparison forever and
//! drift-correct the aircraft's world frame with a wrong pose.
