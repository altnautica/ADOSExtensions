//! Atlas capture ingest: turn the keyframe + capture-state events a drone
//! forwards to the compute node into a reconstructor-ingestible dataset and a
//! reconstruct job.
//!
//! A compute node receives framed `AtlasEvent`s off a bearer (LAN / WFB / cloud)
//! into its event router. This is the seam between that receive side and the job
//! queue. Two things happen here:
//!
//! - A keyframe event carries the image bytes plus the pose and intrinsics; the
//!   [`KeyframePersister`] streams the image to disk and records its frame. This
//!   touches no store state, so it runs WITHOUT the engine lock.
//! - The terminal `Bagged` capture-state finalizes the on-disk dataset (writes
//!   `transforms.json`) and produces the dataset + `Reconstruct` job for the
//!   caller to submit under its store lock. The dataset carries `input_path` so a
//!   backend trains on the real images, not the empty default.
//!
//! A malformed frame is dropped + logged (never an error that could tear down the
//! receive loop); only a real filesystem fault propagates from [`AtlasIngest::step`].
