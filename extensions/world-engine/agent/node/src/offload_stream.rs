//! The streaming perception-offload session (node side).
//!
//! An NPU-less drone opens a session and streams its camera to this node; the
//! node runs the detector and streams detections back. Unlike a one-shot
//! [`crate::ComputeJobKind::PerceptionOffload`] job (one frame per job), a session
//! is continuous: [`run_offload_session`] pulls frames from an
//! [`OffloadFrameStream`] and emits an [`OffloadDetectionBatch`] onto a channel the
//! daemon forwards to the session's WS subscribers.
//!
//! A live source can decode frames faster than the detector infers. Rather than
//! run the model over a growing backlog (so detections trail the moving scene),
//! the live path decouples ingestion from inference: a background reader keeps
//! publishing the NEWEST decoded frame into a depth-1 channel, and the consumer
//! always infers on the freshest one, dropping any frames it was too slow for.
//! Detections track the scene instead of lagging behind it. A finite/replay
//! source keeps exact sequential semantics (one batch per frame, in order).
//!
//! Two frame sources share the trait: [`RtspFrameStream`] pulls the drone's live
//! RTSP feed (the real path — the drone already publishes `rtsp://…:8554/main`)
//! and drives the process-latest path; [`VecFrameStream`] replays a fixed set of
//! frames for tests + the SITL gate and drives the sequential path. Inference runs
//! on a blocking thread so a slow model never starves the async runtime.

///    frame's inference, on the one path whose whole product promise is that
///    detections track the moving scene.
/// 2. **No backpressure.** The blocking pool's queue is unbounded and grows to
///    ~512 threads, so a detector slower than the frame rate silently
///    accumulates work instead of pushing back. The depth-1 request channel
///    here IS the backpressure: the async side awaits, so a slow model slows
///    ingestion rather than growing a queue.
/// 3. **Thread affinity.** A real backend caches per-thread state (an ONNX
///    Runtime session's arena, a CUDA context). Bouncing across pool workers
///    re-warms it; one owned thread does not.
