//! Node-side streaming-session manager: the auto-start + supervise half of the
//! offload path.
//!
//! A one-shot [`crate::ComputeJobKind::PerceptionOffload`] job runs the detector
//! over ONE frame carried in its params. A *streaming session* is different: an
//! NPU-less drone opens a continuous frames→detections lane, streaming its live
//! camera (RTSP) to the node and subscribing to the node's per-session detection
//! WebSocket ([`crate::offload_ws`]). This manager owns that lane on the node.
//!
//! The trigger is still a `PerceptionOffload` job, but one whose params carry a
//! `session` block ([`SessionSpec::from_job_params`]) instead of (or as well as)
//! a single `frame`. The daemon's worker loop, on claiming such a job, hands the
//! spec here — [`OffloadSessionManager::start`] registers a
//! [`crate::StreamingSession`] record and spawns a *supervisor* around
//! [`crate::run_offload_session`]. The supervisor pumps emitted batches into the
//! shared [`DetectionBroadcaster`] the WS router fans out, and it treats a
//! streaming session as a first-class, supervised, restartable unit — not a
//! fire-and-forget task.
//!
//! Session vs. job: a streaming session runs on its own tokio task, OUTSIDE the
//! batch worker pool that drains reconstruction jobs. So a session never occupies
//! a worker slot and never queues behind a reconstruction — batch cannot starve
//! streaming of a worker slot. The one shared resource is raw CPU/GPU; the worker
//! yields to a live session before starting a heavy backend
//! ([`OffloadSessionManager::should_yield_to_streaming`]), but fine-grained
//! CPU/GPU preemption of an in-flight reconstruction is out of scope.
//!
//! Lifecycle: sessions are keyed by id, so a re-submit of a live session is a
//! no-op (idempotent), and a session self-removes from the registry when it ends.
//! A session that dies from a backend fault or a panic is restarted a bounded
//! number of times before it is given up cleanly (never silently dropped, never
//! restart-looping). The registry is the source of truth for `/api/compute/status`
//! (`active_sessions` + a state breakdown) and `/api/compute/sessions` (the live
//! records). [`OffloadSessionManager::stop_all`] tears every session down on
//! shutdown.
