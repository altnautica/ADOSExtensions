//! The world-model descriptor stream (compute -> GCS / drone).
//!
//! The compute node fans out world-model descriptors — a splat, a point cloud, a
//! mesh, an occupancy / ESDF grid — on a broadcast channel, and a consumer
//! subscribes over a per-device WebSocket beside the video relay rather than
//! through the bounded MAVLink queue. Each descriptor is tagged with the drone it
//! belongs to, so a multi-device compute node never cross-talks one drone's world
//! into another's view. A slow subscriber that lags is skipped, never blocking
//! the trainer; a disconnected one is reaped even while the stream is idle.
//!
//! # Why this carries generation-versioned descriptors and not deltas
//!
//! This lane was specified as an "SPZ delta" stream: the trainer would emit
//! incremental splat diffs and the viewer would apply them. That cannot be built
//! as specified, and the reason is a property of the formats rather than a
//! missing implementation. SPZ and SOG are whole-scene containers: both apply
//! GLOBAL quantisation and Morton-order the gaussians, so a single added splat
//! perturbs the ordering and the quantisation ranges of the whole payload.
//! Neither the container formats nor the Khronos glTF extensions
//! (`KHR_gaussian_splatting`, `KHR_gaussian_splatting_compression_spz`) define an
//! incremental append or a delta codec. "SPZ deltas" would therefore have meant
//! inventing, shipping and maintaining a codec no other tool on earth reads, on
//! a flight-adjacent lane, for a benefit — seeing the model grow — that is
//! obtainable without it.
//!
//! So what actually rides here is what the field uses: an immutable artifact set
//! per monotonically-increasing `generation`, described by a small descriptor
//! carrying a level-of-detail chunk manifest. The viewer fetches the coarsest
//! level of the new generation first and refines, which puts pixels on screen in
//! well under a second on a scene whose full transfer takes minutes, and it
//! diffs chunk lists between generations to avoid refetching what has not
//! changed. Identical operator-visible behaviour, no bespoke codec.
//!
//! The mechanism below is deliberately agnostic to which descriptor it carries:
//! it moves framed [`AtlasEvent`]s tagged by device, so adding a topic needs no
//! transport change.
